# Innomatics Research Labs - RWD by using Bootstrap Assignment(Internship)

## Overview

This project(TASK 5) was completed as part of my internship with Innomatics Research Labs. 
This project is a **Responsive frontend website** developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
It aims to showcase various training programs, events, and services offered by the institute through an engaging and interactive web interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, thanks to Bootstrap and custom CSS.
  
- **Navigation Menu**: The navigation bar includes links to different sections such as Courses, Internships, Events, and About Us. It collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens for better usability.

- **Interactive Carousel**: A Bootstrap carousel component displays engaging images related to the training programs and services, enhancing the visual appeal of the site.

- **Content Sections**: The website includes detailed sections for:
  - About the institute
  - Available courses
  - Benefits of choosing Innomatics
